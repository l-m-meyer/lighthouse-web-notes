  - `git init` // initializes an empty repo

* `git status` checks if there are changes to the file(s) in the working directory

* `git diff` shows changes made in the current working directory.

* git add 
  - Adds a files into staging to save permanently
  - `git add <filename>`

* git commit
  - `git commit -m "description"` 
  - `git log` will show all current commits

* git push

* bonus - branches?

##### TIPS FOR GIT
- Commit often
-`git add _file_names`
-`git commit -m "_commit_message_"`
- present tense commit messages are common, but every company has their own style for commit messages
