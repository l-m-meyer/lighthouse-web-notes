## Testing
- Why do we write tests?
* To amek sure our code is running properly
* To ensure things are working well
* To make sure new code doesn't mess with old code
* To state explicitly what we actually want our code to do
* To save future self from any problems after pushing the code and it breaks

### Test Driven Development (TDD)
We write tests first, then we write the code to pass the tests.

* Writing tests will initially be a slow process. 

* The more we write tests, the better off we will be in the future.

* Code-along [palindrome.js](./palindrome.js)
